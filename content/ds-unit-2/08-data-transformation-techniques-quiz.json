      "type": "multiple-choice-single",
      "text": "What is the primary purpose of 'Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)'?",
      "options": [
        {"id": "a", "text": "To transform data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1."},
        {"id": "b", "text": "To remove noise from time series data."},
        {"id": "c", "text": "To scale numerical features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1]."},
        {"id": "d", "text": "To group continuous data into discrete bins."}
      ],
      "correctOptionId": "c",
      "explanation": "Normalization (Min-Max Scaling) rescales features to a specific range, most commonly [0, 1]."
    },
    {
      "id": "u2s8q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "text": "Standardization (Z-score Scaling) is highly sensitive to outliers.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "Standardization is generally less sensitive to outliers compared to Min-Max scaling because it uses the mean and standard deviation, which are themselves affected by outliers but don't define the bounds of the transformation as min/max values do."

      "text": "Which of the following are examples of 'Data Generalization'? (Select all that apply)",
      "options": [
        {"id": "a", "text": "Replacing an age of '32' with an 'Adult' category."},
        {"id": "b", "text": "Calculating the sum of sales for each region."},
        {"id": "c", "text": "Converting specific city names like 'New York', 'Los Angeles' to a broader 'USA' category."},
        {"id": "d", "text": "Applying a log transformation to a skewed numerical feature."}
      ],
      "correctOptionIds": ["a", "c"],
      "explanation": "Data generalization involves replacing specific values with broader categories or concepts. Aggregation (like sum of sales) is a summarization, and log transformation is a value transformation, not generalization in this context."
