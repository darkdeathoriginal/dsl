      "text": "The Z-score method for outlier detection is robust and not affected by extreme values in the dataset.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "The Z-score method uses the mean and standard deviation, both of which are sensitive to extreme values (outliers), making the Z-score itself less robust in such cases."

      "correctOptionId": "c",
      "explanation": "While sometimes outliers might be kept, completely ignoring them without understanding or specific intent is generally not a good strategy as they can significantly skew results. Other options are valid handling techniques depending on the context."
