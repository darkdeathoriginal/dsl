    {
      "id": "u1s9q1",
      "type": "multiple-choice-single",
      "text": "Which statement about Pandas Index objects is TRUE?",
      "options": [
        {"id": "a", "text": "They are mutable, meaning their values can be changed in place."},
        {"id": "b", "text": "They are immutable, and attempting to modify them will raise an error."},
        {"id": "c", "text": "They can only hold integer labels."},
        {"id": "d", "text": "They are primarily used for storing the main data of a DataFrame."}
      ],
      "correctOptionId": "b",
      "explanation": "Pandas Index objects are immutable. This ensures their integrity when shared among multiple DataFrames or Series."
    },
    {
      "id": "u1s9q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "text": "The `reindex()` method in Pandas modifies the DataFrame or Series in place by default.",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "`reindex()` creates a new object with the conformed index by default. To modify in place, you would need to use `inplace=True` (though this is often discouraged)."
    },
    {
      "id": "u1s9q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice-single",
      "text": "What is the primary purpose of the `df1.add(df2, fill_value=0)` operation?",
      "options": [
        {"id": "a", "text": "To add a new column named 'fill_value' with all zeros."},
        {"id": "b", "text": "To replace all values in df1 and df2 with 0 before adding them."},
        {"id": "c", "text": "To perform addition, and for any labels not present in both DataFrames, use 0 instead of NaN during the operation."},
        {"id": "d", "text": "To append df2 to df1, filling any new rows with 0."}
      ],
      "correctOptionId": "c",
      "explanation": "When adding DataFrames, `fill_value=0` means that for index/column labels that don't align, Pandas will substitute 0 for the missing value from one of the DataFrames before performing the addition, thus avoiding NaNs in those positions in the sum."
