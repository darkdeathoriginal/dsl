# 2. Data Types & Facets of Data

Understanding the different types of data is fundamental in Data Science.

## Types of Data:

-   **Structured Data:** Organized in rows/columns (databases, spreadsheets).
    ```
    Example: A table of customer information with columns like Name, Age, City.
    ```

-   **Unstructured Data:** Lacks a clear, predefined structure.
    ```
    Examples: Text documents, emails, social media posts, images, audio files, video files.
    ```
    <CodeBlock
      initialCode={`# Example of handling a simple string (unstructured text)\ntext_data = "Data Science is fascinating."\nword_count = len(text_data.split())\nprint(f"The text is: '{text_data}'")\nprint(f"Number of words: {word_count}")`}
    />

-   **Natural Language:** Human languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Chinese). Analyzing this requires Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

-   **Machine-generated Data:** Produced automatically by systems or sensors.
    ```
    Examples: Server logs, sensor readings (temperature, location), clickstream data from websites.
    ```

-   **Graph-based/Network Data:** Models relationships between entities.
    ```
    Examples: Social networks (users and their connections), knowledge graphs, protein interaction networks.
    ```

-   **Audio, Video, Image Data:** Multimedia data that often requires specialized processing techniques (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition).

-   **Streaming Data:** Data that is generated continuously in real-time.
    ```
    Examples: Stock market tickers, IoT sensor data streams, live social media feeds, transaction data.
    ```
